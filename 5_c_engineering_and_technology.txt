University Institute of Engineering and Technology (UIET) is an on campus engineering institute. It offers undergraduate B.E. , Postgraduate M.E. 
and Doctoral D.Tech. courses. UIET is in the southern campus of Panjab University, Sector 25, Chandigarh. It has two academic blocks which include 
labs, offices, library, and lecture halls. There are blocks for mechanical labs and workshops. There is an ATM. Wi-Fi and Internet access is 
provided in some parts of the campus. Students are from all over the nation: few are day scholars and many live in hostels which provide 
accommodation, food, washrooms, and sporting facilities.

University Institute for Chemical Engineering and Technology (UICET), originally called the Department of Chemical Engineering and Technology, 
UICET came out of a demand to make the sciences of direct use to society. The department was disrupted during the partition of India when most of 
the faculty and students chose to come to India. For a few years, it was housed in Delhi. Then in 1958, it shifted to its present premises in 
Chandigarh. In collaboration with the Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago. Professor R. E. Peck from IIT Chicago joined as the first Head. 
Over the years the department evolved into the University Institute for Chemical Engineering and Technology. In 1983, an Energy Research Institute 
was added within the UICET building to promote R&D in the field of renewable energy.
